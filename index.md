## posting progress

Thanks to the Infinte Wisdom of our Lord and saviour Moot, we now
have two different formats to post our game in motion with.

### WEB 'EM

webm files are just video files that get their sound stripped out
when they're posted on 4chan. They are functionally identical to gifs, but with a much better compression ratio, which naturally leads to longer, better looking loops.

*	<https://github.com/TheTarkus/WebMCam>

Nowadays, you can just use WebmCam, which provides a point'n'shoot interface for grabbing screencaps.
If that's too easy for you, the ~~right~~ *old* way to make webm files is to
create video files using a screen capture tool, edit if them if
necessary, and then convert them to webm. This is understandably a pain, but worth knowing how to do, in case you want to make a longer video to put on youtube, or are on a platform where webmcam doesn't exist.

*	<http://exkode.com/dxtory-features-en.html>

	<http://obsproject.com>

	<http://fraps.com/>

	On Windows, these three programs will get video files of your game
in some format or the other. Since video encoding is actually a complex
business I suggest you google around for advice. Dxtory is good for long
or complex videos that would normally kill your rig, OBS can record most
anything competently, and fraps is buggy shit that people still use for
some reason. If you have a recent NVIDIA card, you may be able to use
the built-in video encoder to record, too. Caveat Emptor.

*	<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Vegas_Pro>

	For video editors, anything will do, but a common favorite for
gaming is Sony Vegas. Figure it out nerd.

*	<http://github.com/WebMBro/WebMConverter>

	Once you have the video, you need to convert into the webm format
4chan expects. WebMConverter provides a retard-friendly interface for
that.

Once you've gotten past this gauntlet you should have a webm as good as any other, as well as raw footage for any of your other video needs.

### JIFS
If that doesn't float your boat, you can always make crusty old gifs with these point-and-shoot tools.

*	<http://cockos.com/licecap/>

	<http://blog.bahraniapps.com/?page_id=21>

	record your vidya to show to all your little internet buddies and complain when the colors come out wrong.

*	<http://github.com/WebMBro/WebMConverter>

	If you go over the file limit, you can convert to webm, but keep in
mind that this won't have nearly as good results as the native webm chain.

### Misc. hosting

*	<http://dropbox.com>

	Dropbox makes sharing webpages as easy as moving the finished page
into the Dropbox folder. Good for Unity webgames and HTML5 concoctions,
and you can host/change your packaged games here too.

* 	<http://1339.cf/>
	
	Filehosting using the pomf.se software, direct linking is allowed. Can
	be used for flash/love2d games, and is great for really any other
	game installers or files.

* 	<http://itch.io>

	If you think your game is ready for the big leagues, you can start
to beg for money by posting it on itch.io. Think of it like bandcamp but
for shitty games nobody wants to buy. The admin is very liberal about
hosting, to the point where it basically charity to new gamedevs.

*	<http://mega.co.nz>

	Use mega as a last resort. They'll host whatever, but the fact that
it doesn't provide any direct links and that it's blocked for many an
anon make it a pain to use.

*	<http://pastebin.com>

	<http://hastebin.com>

	Don't try to post your shit code to 4chan directly, use a pastebin. hastebin will autodetect language for syntax highlighting, which is nice.

	Use/track those first two tags, they are progress specific.

## Free shit

All free shit will either be labeled CC-NOPE meaning not actually "free" per se and will probably slam you with a C&D, CC-BY-NC, meaning it cannot be used commercially, or CC0 meaning do whatever the fuck you want. Note that I am using these as umbrella licenses and they may or may not actually apply.

### Free Sounds

*	<http://www.freesound.org>

	A sound effect portal, includes both amateur and professional work. Not really geared toward gamedev. (CC-BY-NC)

*	<http://www.bfxr.net>

	Lofi bleeps 'n bloops synth. Click the mutate button and get 100% original, low-effort effects. Like sfxr but better. (CC0)

*	<https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=vgm&filter.license=to_modify_commercially>

	Creative Commons licensed soundcloud tracks. Modify the search to fit your needs. (CC0)

### Free Grafix

*	<http://www.spriters-resource.com/>

	Sprites from existing games. (CC-NOPE)

*	<http://opengameart.org/>

	A portal for placeholder art. Licences vary. (CC-BY-NC)

### Free(/Open-Source) Software

*	<https://github.com/amgade/gamedev-alternatives>

	Gamedev in a way that respects your freedumbs. Some of these are drop-in replacements for existing software, while others just fill the same gap. One of the easiest ways to get to do some collab work is to pick a project, get to work, and submit a pull request when you're done. (CC0/CC-BY-NC)

### 100% Original Ideas Don't Steal

## Ancient history

Everything here is considered `DEPRECATED`.

*	<http://vsrecommendedgames.wikia.com/wiki/Games_Made_by_/V/irgins>

	An old project list, Dates back to the /v/ days.

*	<http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14853701/AGDG/Dropbox.html>

	NG's Archive. updated till the end of July 2013.

	`>;_;7`

*	<https://www.copy.com/s/cVIdHlFyhkDR/AGDG>

	The copybox archive. Lasts most of august 2013.

*	<http://sites.google.com/site/vidyadevresources>

	More /v/ links. The tutorials are probably still fresh but the content/suggestions definitely aren't.

*	<http://pastebin.com/xM5d4qu1>

	A list of game library suggestions. Supposedly updated 2013, but the info calls now mature libraries indev and and references dead relics.
	
	

*	<http://pomf.se>

	Shut down as of June 2015 due to lack of funding. [read more](http://blog.pomf.se/post/121058516206/shutting-down)
	Filehosting for NEETs and weebs. Unlike every other public file
	host, pomf trusts its users enough to directly link to their files. Good
	for flash/love2d games, and basically anything else.
